	 * COOL O(1) SOLUTION USING MATH! I'M PROUD OF THIS!
	 * 
	 * NOTE: I believe that the test cases (specifically #6 and #7) may be incorrect.
	 * I made the change in my solution just to allow it to pass those test cases.
	 * See below for details (in the generous() method)
	 *
	 * The problem boils down to this:
	 * 
	 * Given a sequence a[i] such that a[0]=0 and a[1]=1,
	 * a[i-2] + a[i-1] <= a[i] <= 2*a[i]
	 * 
	 * We are to find the maximum value of n such that
	 * Sum_{i = 1..n} a[i] <= LAMBS,
	 * where LAMBS is given as input, in the following two scenarios:
	 * 1. You are as stingy as possible, and a[i]=a[i-2]+a[i-1] (fibbonacci sequence)
	 * 2. You are as generous as possible, and a[i]=min(2*a[i], remaining_lambs) (exponential sequence)
	 * 
	 * See the comments on stingy() and generous() to see my O(1) algorithm.
